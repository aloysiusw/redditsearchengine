Need to hold enough stuff for a week or so. Price-wise I guess about £250 per suitcase would be what I'd be aiming to stay under (but if there's a compelling case to go a bit over I'm happy to hear it).\\n\\nWe did get given a load of John Lewis vouchers when we got married recently so buying from there would be *ideal* but not a requirement. I was initially looking at the Samsonite bags from there but it sounds like their quality has really dropped off. I wondered whether the various Eastpak case are worth considering?\\n\\nMany thanks\",\n",
